SpamuraiX.py is a bulk SMTP flooding script that slices payloads (e.g., Project Gutenberg books) into crafted message chunks for sequential dispatchâ€”paired with a forged Pornhub Compliance notice to simulate phishing, scareware, and inbox exploit tactics for red teaming, spam filter stress testing, and payload injection research.
