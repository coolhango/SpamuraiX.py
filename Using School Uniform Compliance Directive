School Uniform Compliance Directive Overview
This project serves as a tool for automating school uniform compliance reminders at the School of Science and Technology (SST). The system sends regular reminders to students regarding the strict uniform policy enforced by the school. These emails are intended to ensure that all students meet the school's dress code and grooming standards without exception, contributing to a professional and disciplined learning environment. The school’s policy requires students to arrive in full formal uniform every Monday. This includes wearing the official SST regulation shirt, trousers or skirt, approved belt and shoes, and ensuring grooming aligns with the institution's standards. Additionally, any unsanctioned social ideologies, including but not limited to Pride-related expressions, are strictly prohibited on school grounds. Any violations of this policy will lead to disciplinary actions.

The main goals of this project are as follows:
1. Ensure consistent uniform compliance by reminding students about the importance of following the school uniform guidelines consistently.
2. Automate the reminder process through hourly emails that help students prepare their uniforms and follow school rules.
3. Enforce strict policy adherence by emphasizing, in each reminder, that violations of the uniform code will result in immediate and formal disciplinary actions, with no appeals allowed.

Key Features
1. Automated email reminders are sent once every hour, ensuring that students stay informed about the uniform policy.
2. High-impact messaging is used to communicate the seriousness of compliance, leaving no room for excuses.
3. Compliance tracking can be configured to verify whether reminders are being sent and if the directive is being followed.
4. Strict disciplinary measures are clearly outlined in the emails, including item confiscation, demerits, privilege suspension, and referral to the disciplinary board.

How the System Works
1. The system sends automated email reminders every hour to a designated recipient. Each message includes a reminder of the school’s uniform policy and potential consequences for violations. A Python script manages this process using the smtplib library for sending and the email.message library for formatting.
2. The script checks uniform compliance according to school standards and ensures reminders persist until the student complies.

(Email Template) Each reminder email contains:
1. A subject line warning about uniform compliance.
2. An introduction from the school outlining the formal compliance directive.
3.A breakdown of uniform and grooming requirements.
4. Consequences for non-compliance, such as confiscation, demerits, and privilege suspension.
5. A call to action encouraging students to prepare in advance.
6. A note advising students with genuine issues to contact Student Services beforehand.

(Technical Details) The script includes:
1. Creation of email messages using the EmailMessage class.
2. SMTP connection to Gmail’s server with user credentials.
3. Cron job-based scheduling to send emails hourly.
4. Basic error handling for reliable operation.

(Running the Script) To run the script locally:
1. Ensure Python 3 is installed.
2. Install required libraries using:
pip install smtplib email
3. Edit the script with sender, recipient, and app password details.
- Make the script executable: chmod +x /path/to/your/script.py

4. What is a Cron Job?
A cron job is a time-based scheduler in Unix-like systems that automates the execution of scripts at set intervals.

1. How to Set Up a Cron Job on macOS

Step 1: Open Terminal
Launch Terminal from Applications > Utilities or by searching "Terminal".

Step 2: Set Default Text Editor to nano
Set nano as the default editor by entering:
export VISUAL=nano  
export EDITOR=nano

Step 3: Make the Python Script Executable
Run:
chmod +x "/Users/..."

Step 4: Open Crontab
Use the command:
crontab -e

Step 5: Add the Cron Job
To run the script hourly, add:
0 * * * * /usr/bin/python3 "/Users/..."

Step 6: Save and Exit
In nano, press Ctrl + O to save, then Enter, and Ctrl + X to exit.

Step 7: Confirm Cron Job
Check with:
crontab -l

Step 8: Test the Script
Wait until the next hour and check the email inbox to confirm.

_________________________________
Conclusion
You now have a functioning hourly cron job on macOS to run the uniform compliance reminder script. Update it at any time using crontab -e.

Disciplinary Measures:
1. Automated reminders clearly state the consequences of non-compliance:
    Confiscation of non-compliant items.
    Demerit entries added to student records.
    Suspension from events and activities.
    Review by the disciplinary board for repeat offenses.
